1. Go to https://planetscale.com and create an account

You will be redirected to the dashboard.

2. Click **Create a new database**

   1. Name your database whatever you want.
   2. Choose the region closest to you.
   3. Choose **Hobby** as the plan type.
   4. You will need to provide a credit card to continue. You won't be charged.
   5. Click **Create Database**.

You will be redirected to the integrations page. Select **Drizzle** and choose a password name.

Scroll down to the **Add credentials to .env** sectio and copy those values to your `.env.local` file. Set your database name as the `DATABASE_NAME` value.

Lastly, run `pnpm run db:push`

## Local Alternative

If you don't want to use PlanetScale, or don't have a credit card, you can use a local MySQL database. MySQL is open source and free to use.
[Here are instructions to get started](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/#mysql-getting-started-installing).

Enter `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD` values in `.env.local`

Run `pnpm run db:push`
